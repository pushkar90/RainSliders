4. Add the skins you want to your rainmeter

Troubleshooting:
Cannot delete resources folder / Cannot install new rmskin:
  This will almost always be because of the ClickMonitorDDC utility being in use

  Exit ClickMonitorDDC -> taskbar / task manager
  try again, if all else fails, try restarting the computer.
